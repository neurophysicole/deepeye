  abstract = {One of the challenges in modeling cognitive events from electroencephalogram (EEG) data is finding representations that are invariant to inter- and intra-subject differences, as well as to inherent noise associated with such data. Herein, we propose a novel approach for learning such representations from multi-channel EEG time-series, and demonstrate its advantages in the context of mental load classification task. First, we transform EEG activities into a sequence of topology-preserving multi-spectral images, as opposed to standard EEG analysis techniques that ignore such spatial information. Next, we train a deep recurrent-convolutional network inspired by state-of-the-art video classification to learn robust representations from the sequence of images. The proposed approach is designed to preserve the spatial, spectral, and temporal structure of EEG which leads to finding features that are less sensitive to variations and distortions within each dimension. Empirical evaluation on the cognitive load classification task demonstrated significant improvements in classification accuracy over current state-of-the-art approaches in this field.},

  abstract = {Yarbus' pioneering work in eye tracking has been influential to methodology and in demonstrating the apparent importance of task in eliciting different fixation patterns. There has been renewed interest in Yarbus' assertions on the importance of task in recent years, driven in part by a greater capability to apply quantitative methods to fixation data analysis. A number of recent research efforts have examined the extent to which an observer's task may be predicted from recorded fixation data. This body of recent work has raised a number of interesting questions, with some investigations calling for closer examination of the validity of Yarbus' claims, and subsequent efforts revealing some of the nuances involved in carrying out this type of analysis including both methodological, and data related considerations. In this paper, we present an overview of prior efforts in task prediction, and assess different types of statistics drawn from fixation data, or images in their ability to predict task from gaze. We also examine the extent to which relatively general task definitions (free-viewing, object-search, saliency-viewing, explicit saliency) may be predicted by spatial positioning of fixations, features co-located with fixation points, fixation dynamics and scene structure. This is accomplished in considering the data of Koehler et al. (2014) [30] affording a larger scale, and qualitatively different corpus of data for task prediction relative to existing efforts. Based on this analysis, we demonstrate that both spatial position, as well as local features are of value in distinguishing general task categories. The methods proposed provide a general framework for highlighting features that distinguish behavioural differences observed across visual tasks, and we relate new task prediction results in this paper to the body of prior work in this domain. Finally, we also comment on the value of task prediction and classification models in general in understanding facets of gaze behaviour.},

Results showed that task influenced a number of eye movement measures including the number of fixations and gaze duration on specific objects. Additional analyses revealed that the areas fixated were qualitatively different between the two tasks. However, other measures such as average saccade amplitude and individual fixation durations remained constant across the viewing of the scene and across tasks. The present study demonstrates that viewing task biases the selection of scene regions and aggregate measures of fixation time on those regions but does not influence other measures, such as the duration of individual fixations.},

  abstract = {How people look at visual information reveals fundamental information about them; their interests and their states of mind. Previous studies showed that scanpath, i.e., the sequence of eye movements made by an observer exploring a visual stimulus, can be used to infer observer-related (e.g., task at hand) and stimuli-related (e.g., image semantic category) information. However, eye movements are complex signals and many of these studies rely on limited gaze descriptors and bespoke datasets. Here, we provide a turnkey method for scanpath modeling and classification. This method relies on variational hidden Markov models (HMMs) and discriminant analysis (DA). HMMs encapsulate the dynamic and individualistic dimensions of gaze behavior, allowing DA to capture systematic patterns diagnostic of a given class of observers and/or stimuli. We test our approach on two very different datasets. Firstly, we use fixations recorded while viewing 800 static natural scene images, and infer an observer-related characteristic: the task at hand. We achieve an average of 55.9\% correct classification rate (chance = 33\%). We show that correct classification rates positively correlate with the number of salient regions present in the stimuli. Secondly, we use eye positions recorded while viewing 15 conversational videos, and infer a stimulus-related characteristic: the presence or absence of original soundtrack. We achieve an average 81.2\% correct classification rate (chance = 50\%). HMMs allow to integrate bottom-up, top-down, and oculomotor influences into a single model of gaze behavior. This synergistic approach between behavior and machine learning will open new avenues for simple quantification of gazing behavior. We release SMAC with HMM, a Matlab toolbox freely available to the community under an open-source license agreement.},

The strong claim of this very influential finding has an never been rigorously tested. Our observers viewed photographs for 10 seconds each. They performed one of four image-based tasks while eye movements were recorded. A pattern classifier, given features from the static scan paths, could identify the image and the observer at above-chance levels. However, it could not predict a viewer's task. Shorter and longer (60 sec) viewing epochs produced similar results. Critically, human judges also failed to identify the tasks performed by the observers based on the static scan paths. The Yarbus finding is evocative, and while it is possible an observer's mental state might be decoded from some aspect of eye movements, static scan paths alone do not appear to be adequate to infer complex mental states of an observer.},

We applied this technique to a challenging dataset consisting of eye movement trajectories obtained from subjects viewing monochrome images of real scenes tasked with answering questions regarding the scenes.

Dependent variables were DS accuracy, RT, and task-evoked pupillary responses (TEPRs) to digits as estimates of mental effort. Participants maintained almost the same level of DS accuracy on dual as on DS only and sacrificed speed on the RT task. As expected, TEPRs increased linearly with memory load in both DS only and dual. Although TEPRs were initially higher in dual than in DS only, the slope of the increase was shallower in dual.

First, by clustering the eye gaze patterns, the regions of interest (ROIs) on the displayed image are extracted. A deep convolutional neural network is then trained and used to recognize the objects in each ROI. Finally, the intended task is predicted by using support vector machine (SVM) through learning the embedded relationship between recognized objects.

  abstract = {The aim of the study was not only to demonstrate whether eye-movement-based task decoding was possible but also to investigate whether eye-movement patterns can be used to identify cognitive processes behind the tasks. We compared eye-movement patterns elicited under different task conditions, with tasks differing systematically with regard to the types of cognitive processes involved in solving them. We used four tasks, differing along two dimensions: spatial (global vs. local) processing (Navon, Cognit Psychol, 9(3):353\textendash 383 1977) and semantic (deep vs. shallow) processing (Craik and Lockhart, J Verbal Learn Verbal Behav, 11(6):671\textendash 684 1972). We used eye-movement patterns obtained from two time periods: fixation cross preceding the target stimulus and the target stimulus. We found significant effects of both spatial and semantic processing, but in case of the latter, the effect might be an artefact of insufficient task control. We found above chance task classification accuracy for both time periods: 51.4\% for the period of stimulus presentation and 34.8\% for the period of fixation cross presentation. Therefore, we show that task can be to some extent decoded from the preparatory eye-movements before the stimulus is displayed. This suggests that anticipatory eye-movements reflect the visual scanning strategy employed for the task at hand. Finally, this study also demonstrates that decoding is possible even from very scant eye-movement data similar to Coco and Keller, J Vis 14(3):11\textendash 11 (2014). This means that task decoding is not limited to tasks that naturally take longer to perform and yield multi-second eye-movement recordings.},

In a similar time frame, "deep learning" (a term for the use of artificial neural networks with convolutional, recurrent, or similarly sophisticated architectures) has produced a parallel revolution in the field of machine learning and has been employed across a wide variety of applications. Traditional MVPA also uses a form of machine learning, but most commonly with much simpler techniques based on linear calculations; a number of studies have applied deep learning techniques to neuroimaging data, but we believe that those have barely scratched the surface of the potential deep learning holds for the field. In this paper, we provide a brief introduction to deep learning for those new to the technique, explore the logistical pros and cons of using deep learning to analyze neuroimaging data - which we term "deep MVPA," or dMVPA - and introduce a new software toolbox (the "Deep Learning In Neuroimaging: Exploration, Analysis, Tools, and Education" package, DeLINEATE for short) intended to facilitate dMVPA for neuroscientists (and indeed, scientists more broadly) everywhere.},

  abstract = {The early eye tracking studies of Yarbus provided descriptive evidence that an observer's task influences patterns of eye movements, leading to the tantalizing prospect that an observer's intentions could be inferred from their saccade behavior. We investigate the predictive value of task and eye movement properties by creating a computational cognitive model of saccade selection based on instructed task and internal cognitive state using a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN). Understanding how humans generate saccades under different conditions and cognitive sets links recent work on salience models of low-level vision with higher level cognitive goals. This model provides a Bayesian, cognitive approach to topdown transitions in attentional set in pre-frontal areas along with vector-based saccade generation from the superior colliculus. Our approach is to begin with eye movement data that has previously been shown to differ across task. We first present an analysis of the extent to which individual saccadic features are diagnostic of an observer's task. Second, we use those features to infer an underlying cognitive state that potentially differs from the instructed task. Finally, we demonstrate how changes of cognitive state over time can be incorporated into a generative model of eye movement vectors without resorting to an external decision homunculus. Internal cognitive state frees the model from the assumption that instructed task is the only factor influencing observers' saccadic behavior. While the inclusion of hidden temporal state does not improve the classification accuracy of the model, it does allow accurate prediction of saccadic sequence results observed in search paradigms. Given the generative nature of this model, it is capable of saccadic simulation in real time. We demonstrated that the properties from its generated saccadic vectors closely match those of human observers given a particular task and cognitive state. Many current models of vision focus entirely on bottom-up salience to produce estimates of spatial Bareas of interest\^within a visual scene. While a few recent models do add top-down knowledge and task information, we believe our contribution is important in three key ways. First, we incorporate task as learned attentional sets that are capable of self-transition given only information available to the visual system. This matches influential theories of bias signals by (Miller and Cohen Annu Rev Neurosci 24:167\textendash 202, 2001) and implements selection of state without simply shifting the decision to an external homunculus. Second, our model is generative and capable of predicting sequence artifacts in saccade generation like those found in visual search. Third, our model generates relative saccadic vector information as opposed to absolute spatial coordinates. This matches more closely the internal saccadic representations as they are generated in the superior colliculus.},

  abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to examine the influence of task set on the spatial and temporal characteristics of eye movements during scene perception. In previous work, when strong control was exerted over the viewing task via specification of a target object (as in visual search), task set biased spatial, rather than temporal, parameters of eye movements. Here, we find that more participant-directed tasks (in which the task establishes general goals of viewing rather than specific objects to fixate) affect not only spatial (e.g., saccade amplitude) but also temporal parameters (e.g., fixation duration). Further, task set influenced the rate of change in fixation duration over the course of viewing but not saccade amplitude, suggesting independent mechanisms for control of these parameters.},

  abstract = {We investigated the processing effort during visual search and counting tasks using a pupil dilation measure. Search difficulty was manipulated by varying the number of distractors as well as the heterogeneity of the distractors. More difficult visual search resulted in more pupil dilation than did less difficult search. These results confirm a link between effort and increased pupil dilation. The pupil dilated more during the counting task than during target-absent search, even though the displays were identical, and the two tasks were matched for reaction time. The moment-to-moment dilation pattern during search suggests little effort in the early stages, but increasingly more effort towards response, whereas the counting task involved an increased initial effort, which was sustained throughout the trial. These patterns can be interpreted in terms of the differential memory load for item locations in each task. In an additional experiment, increasing the spatial memory requirements of the search evoked a corresponding increase in pupil dilation. These results support the view that search tasks involve some, but limited, memory for item locations, and the effort associated with this memory load increases during the trials. In contrast, counting involves a heavy locational memory component from the start.},

  abstract = {Representations learned by deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for object recognition are a widely investigated model of the processing hierarchy in the human visual system. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, CNN representations of visual stimuli have previously been shown to correspond to processing stages in the ventral and dorsal streams of the visual system. Whether this correspondence between models and brain signals also holds for activity acquired at high temporal resolution has been explored less exhaustively. Here, we addressed this question by combining CNN-based encoding models with magnetoencephalography (MEG). Human participants passively viewed 1,000 images of objects while MEG signals were acquired. We modelled their high temporal resolution source-reconstructed cortical activity with CNNs, and observed a feed-forward sweep across the visual hierarchy between 75 and 200 ms after stimulus onset. This spatiotemporal cascade was captured by the network layer representations, where the increasingly abstract stimulus representation in the hierarchical network model was reflected in different parts of the visual cortex, following the visual ventral stream. We further validated the accuracy of our encoding model by decoding stimulus identity in a left-out validation set of viewed objects, achieving state-of-the-art decoding accuracy.},

In stark contrast, the published material in English concerning his life is scant. We provide a brief biography of Yarbus and assess his impact on contemporary approaches to research on eye movements. While early interest in his work focused on his study of stabilised retinal images, more recently this has been replaced with interest in his work on the cognitive influences on scanning patterns. We extended his experiment on the effect of instructions on viewing a picture using a portrait of Yarbus rather than a painting. The results obtained broadly supported those found by Yarbus.},

  abstract = {Arousal level changes constantly and it has a profound influence on performance during everyday activities. Fluctuations in arousal are regulated by the autonomic nervous system, which is mainly controlled by the balanced activity of the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems, commonly indexed by heart rate (HR) and galvanic skin response (GSR), respectively. Although a growing number of studies have used pupil size to indicate the level of arousal, research that directly examines the relationship between pupil size and HR or GSR is limited. The goal of this study was to understand how pupil size is modulated by autonomic arousal. Human participants fixated various emotional face stimuli, of which low-level visual properties were carefully controlled, while their pupil size, HR, GSR, and eye position were recorded simultaneously. We hypothesized that a positive correlation between pupil size and HR or GSR would be observed both before and after face presentation. Trial-by-trial positive correlations between pupil diameter and HR and GSR were found before face presentation, with larger pupil diameter observed on trials with higher HR or GSR. However, task-evoked pupil responses after face presentation only correlated with HR. Overall, these results demonstrated a trial-by-trial relationship between pupil size and HR or GSR, suggesting that pupil size can be used as an index for arousal level involuntarily regulated by the autonomic nervous system.},

We compare the different vocabularies of interpretable units as concept detectors emerged from the networks trained to solve different supervised learning tasks such as object recognition on ImageNet and scene classification on Places. The network dissection is further applied to analyze how the units acting as semantic detectors grow and evolve over the training iterations both in the scenario of the train-from-scratch and in the stage of the fine-tuning between data sources. Our results highlight that interpretability is an important property of deep neural networks that provides new insights into their hierarchical structure.},
