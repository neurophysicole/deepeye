MacInnes Notes

- Partial set - no model
- Don't have old Genie files, no longer compatible with new company license
- Final processed input used for training the mean (saccademeans.txt) and single saccade (saccade.dat) models
- combined with graphical representation in manuscript, should be able to replicate
- Any simple Bayesian classifier package should get close to reproducing first part of paper
- Not sure how to reproduce models from second part of paper
- Models from second part of paper were better theoretical fit than statistical fit
- Also included model output tested using BIC & Wilcoxon Rank Tests
