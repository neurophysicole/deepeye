% all classifications came out better than chance.
% the pattern of results was the same between the two tasks..good for the model (not overfitting)

% the raw data were better than the image data, probably because of increased resolution of the data
% in some cases, this can confuse the classifier, but overlapping data seems to provide some important info to the classifier

% this also came out in the important variables feeding into the classifier.
% for the raw timeline data, individual x and y coordinate variables do not provide as strong results as the full output, but pupil size data doesn't seem to make a difference
% for the image data, x or y coordinate data performs just as well as full data, but pupil size doesn't

% x coordinate data seems to be most important.. but kinda sketchy there <-- look at more closely
% if we roll with this, could say that the nature of the scene images probably makes horizontal information more important

% actual image information wasn't accounted for here, because we were just interested in seeing if the computer could pick out patterns in the data
% future iterations could use information to improve relative input from top-down and bottom-up input sources
