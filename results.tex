\section{results}

% different than chance?

% exploratory and confirmatory different?

% different between timeline data and image data?

% different between systematic tests?

\subsection{experiment 1}
_Timeline Data Classification._
% one sample t-test vs chance

_Eye Movement Variables._ %raw timeline data
% for the raw timeline data, the x and y are not good enough

_Image Classification_
% one-sample t-test vs chance

_Eye Movement Variables._ %image subsection
% for the image data, the x and y variables seem to provide enough info to classify at the same level, but not pupil size


\subsection{experiment 9}
% no difference in the pattern of results compared to experiment 1

_Timeline Data Classification._
% one-sample t-test vs chance

_Eye Movement Variables._ %raw timeline data
% same pattern of results as experiment 1

_Image Classification._
% one-sample t-test vs chance

_Eye Movement Variables._ %image data
% same pattern of results as experiment 1
