Deep Learning and Eye Tracking Paper

I setup this document so the main file is R Markdown, then the other files are Markdown. They just plug into the main file. The R Markdown document uses the papaja package for APA format stuff. I believe it also puts out a .tex form of the document when it is compiled (if need)..

- All of the proposed tables have the relevant information included, but are not built or formatted at all (will do in later revision)
- None of the figures have been made either..
- Also, not sure if `\insert` is the right command, that is just what I had for an older version of what I was doing..
- All of the Zotero references will need to be plugged in

Question: Where is a good place to submit this? > ZC/MJ/KK/MD

### TO DOs
TITLE
- Convolutional neural networks can decode eye movement data: A black box alternative for solving the inverse Yarbus problem
* ^ Needs work!  

ABSTRACT
- Needs to be written up (can do once know the journal requirements)

INTRO
- Make Intro table > ZC

METHODS
- Dial down info about the images and double-check the procedure > ZC/MD
- Create the sample scene images (and the Methods figure to go with it) > ZC
- Create average plot image for each condition (and the Methods figure to go with it) > ZC/MJ/KK
- Create the average plots for each condition (and the Methods figure to go with it) > ZC/MJ/KK
- Create the figure describing the CNN architecture > ZC/MJ/KK
- What is a good way to describe how we tried out all of the models?? > MJ
  - Should we include the table breaking down all of the models that we tried? --- seems extra > MJ

RESULTS
- Create acc v chance tables for timeline and image data > ZC
- Create exploratory v confirmatory pattern of results table > ZC
- Do we need to comment on all of the confusion matrices?? <!-- Well, could say something about them being implicated in the memorize condition --> > MJ
- Should we split up the confusion matrices, or present them all in one place? > MJ/KK
- Create all of the confusion matrix figures (or the one big figure, whatever we decide..) > ZC

### NOTES
- Follow-up with foveated stimuli features
- Also thinking of doing a follow-up with time in image and timeline format -- seems to kind of be a thing in the lit


### Other kinda related deep learning thoughts
- Could we use this strategy to predict from non-concussed brain which brains will later receive a concussion (assuming we have baselines from peeps who are not concussed)?
- Could we use this strategy to predict which brains are post-concussion and which brains are not post concussion?
- Could we use this strategy to other cool health-related stuff?
