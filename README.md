Deep Learning and Eye Tracking Paper

### TO DOs
- Need to add the relevant comparisons..
  - Should probably compare filled v. hollow
  - Should probably compare e1 v e9 (hopefully these aren't different)
  - Should probably compare image to timeline data
  - Which sub-comparisons should we run??
  - Maybe a post-hoc type situation where every version is run against each other?
    - Pupil size, x, y
    - What about comparing the removal of a variable against the version that is made up of only that variable? (no pupil size v only pupil size?)
    - Or, should we just be comparing all of these to the all-data condition?
- Need to describe the model.. and maybe provide a graphic or something that shows the relevant aspects of the other exploratory models
- Need to create average .png condition images
- Need to run binomial tests to compare against chance
