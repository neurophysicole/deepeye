Deep Learning and Eye Tracking Paper

I setup this document so the main file is R Markdown, then the other files are Markdown. They just plug into the main file. The R Markdown document uses the papaja package for APA format stuff. I believe it also puts out a .tex form of the document when it is compiled (if need)..

## TO DOs

## NOTES

- Follow-up with foveated stimuli features
- Also thinking of doing a follow-up with time in image and timeline format -- seems to kind of be a thing in the lit

## Other kinda related deep learning thoughts

- Could we use this strategy to predict from non-concussed brain which brains will later receive a concussion (assuming we have baselines from peeps who are not concussed)?
- Could we use this strategy to predict which brains are post-concussion and which brains are not post concussion?
- Could we use this strategy to other cool health-related stuff?
