\section{Conclusion}

This study was the first to provide a solution to the inverse Yarbus problem using (1) non-aggregated eye tracking data (x-coordinates, y-coordinates, pupil size), (2) timeline and image data formats (see Figure X<!-- reference the plot image figure -->), and (3) a "black box" CNN architecture. The CNN was able to decode the image and timeline data better than chance, although only the timeline datasets were rich enough to be decoded with state-of-the-art accuracy. Datasets that were not as rich were not able to differentiate the cognitive processes underlying the memorization task from those underlying the search and rate tasks. Decoding parcellations of the data revealed that pupil size was the least informative component of the eye movement data.

Given the questionable reliability and generalizability surrounding the "black box" nature of CNN classification, the models were first tested on an exploratory dataset, then confirmed using a second unrelated dataset. The findings appear stable and generalizable. Although the timeline data outperformed the image data format, future studies that incorporate stimulus features have the potential to provide a solution to the inverse Yarbus problem that surpasses the current state-of-the-art.<!-- applications? they're already kinda mentioned in the discussion.... -->
